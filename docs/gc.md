# GC

*A non-moving, precise, generational collector. It runs at every worker count.
Tracking starts lazily, so evaluations below the arm line avoid its barriers
and free-list work.*

Without reclamation, heap storage grows with total allocation rather than the
live set. Collection returns unreachable storage to later allocations. Its
measured cost belongs in [perf/model](perf/model.md).

## Pacing (the collection policy)

One clock drives every decision: **allocation volume**, the bytes the heap
stores hand out (fresh TLAB refills plus free-list reuse). Policy depends only
on the evaluation's own heap, never on host RAM, so an evaluation collects at
the same points on every machine. `src/runtime/heap/pacer.zig` owns it.

- **Dormant.** Until volume reaches the arm line (1 GiB; `FIX_GC_ARM=SIZE`),
  nothing is tracked: no young-slot lists, write barriers, or free-list probes.
  Evaluations below the line pay nothing.
- **Arming** stops workers, classifies the existing allocation as old (pinned),
  and enables tracking. The pinned bytes seed the old-generation estimate.
- **Nursery.** After each collection the next one is scheduled
  `growth × old` bytes of allocation later (`FIX_GC_GROWTH=PCT`, default 100),
  clamped to 64 MiB–1 GiB. `old` is the pinned region plus promotions, reset to
  the measured live set at each major. Peak heap is therefore about
  `old · (1 + growth)`, Go's GOGC rule applied to the nursery. The cap bounds
  a minor's survivor trace, so it also bounds the minor's pause.
- **Major gate.** The next collection is a major once `old` exceeds the last
  major's live set by `major_growth` (starting at `growth`, never less than one
  minimum nursery). This geometric gate bounds total major work by a constant
  multiple of the final live set. A major that frees less than a quarter of
  `old` doubles `major_growth` (capped at 1600%). A major that frees half or
  more halves it back. Nix heaps mostly accrete, so low-yield full
  collections, the longest pauses, back off instead of recurring.
- **Soft limit.** `--gc-budget=N` (MiB, or `Nk`/`Nm`/`Ng`) caps `old + nursery`,
  like GOMEMLIMIT. Tracking arms by half the limit and nurseries shrink to
  fit. Nurseries never drop below 64 MiB and the limit never forces a major,
  so a live set above the limit degrades to frequent cheap minors, not a
  livelock of full collections.
  `0` = never collect (allocation stays bump-only).
- **Accounting.** Workers publish volume to one shared counter in 1 MiB steps
  and request a collection when it crosses the pacer's trigger. The fresh path
  charges once per TLAB refill, and reuse charges per allocation inside the
  already-armed branch. The dormant hot path is unchanged.
- **Memory return.** Freed storage stays mapped and reused through the free
  lists. Collection never calls `madvise` or `munmap`, so reuse costs no page
  faults or syscalls. Fresh store growth is prefaulted in 32 MiB chunks
  (`MADV_POPULATE_WRITE`).

## Why non-moving + precise

- **Non-moving.** [ObjectIds](runtime/heap.md) are dense indices baked into thunks, [values](runtime/values.md), and range headers across many *suspended [fibers](parallel/fibers.md)*. Moving objects would require finding and rewriting every ObjectId in parked fiber state. This collector instead keeps objects in place; survivors are promoted in place (the generation bit flips, the id is unchanged) and may leave fragmentation.
- **Precise.** No C-stack / register scan. The collector walks *exact heap edges* from an enumerated root set via the canonical `runtime/heap/edges.zig` trace map, shared with closure validation and tooling. This is why roots must be enumerated explicitly and completely (below) — a missed root is a use-after-free, not a conservative over-retention.

## Generational structure

Routine collections are **minor** and young-gated: each minor examines only the objects allocated since the last collection — recorded per-worker in `HeapLocal.gc_young_slots` (appended on allocation once tracking is armed, cleared after each minor) — so the work is O(young), not O(total). Once promotions pass the pacer's major gate (see Pacing above), the next collection performs a full, non-gated mark and sweep to reclaim unreachable old objects.

- **Young/old.** Objects allocated after arming are young; a minor promotes marked survivors to old (in place) and reclaims the dead.
- **Remembered set.** An old→young write barrier records old objects that come to reference young ones, so the young-gated mark can seed from roots *plus* the remembered set and stop at old boundaries without missing live young children.
- **Incremental chunk-constant scan.** Chunk constants can hold heap references and chunks are never collected, so their constants are permanent roots — but only chunks compiled since the last minor can still reference a young object, so the root scan resumes from `gc_chunks_scanned` rather than rescanning all chunks every cycle.

## Root set

Marking starts from every place a live ObjectId can be reached without going through the heap (`markRoots` in `src/expr/eval/gc_controller.zig`):

```
Root set (all must be enumerated — precise):
  • Every worker VM (via each fiber's VM):
      – operand stack + all Frames        (vm/dispatch.md)
      – Frame.upvalue_owner + upvalues     (runtime/thunks.md)
      – builtins + the value in-flight at the safepoint
  • In-flight force chain    vm.gc_roots.force_chain (the suspended
        forceThunk stack, runtime/thunks.md)
  • Native temp roots        vm.gc_roots.temporary (loop-based builtins
        holding transient objects across allocations)
  • Each fiber's assigned-but-unprocessed task target
  • Scheduler-queued task targets            (parallel/scheduler.md)
  • Thread-local thunk-memo + attr-cache entries (token-keyed;
        auto-invalidated on heap token bump — see below)
  • Transient import VMs                      (parallel/imports.md)
  • Old→young remembered set (seeds the young-gated mark)
  • Chunk constants — pinned, never swept (scanned incrementally)
  • Resolved import results + current-token lazy-derivation cache
```

## Mark

- Precise **seen bitmap**: one bit per ObjectId (marked/live), paired with a
  scanned bitmap. One 64-bit word is a mark page covering 64 adjacent,
  fixed-size object slots.
- Explicit **page worklist**, no recursion (heap graphs are deep). A page is
  queued once while marks accumulate, then its `seen & ~scanned` objects are
  visited in ObjectId order. Closing a concurrent page clears its queued bit,
  rechecks for late marks, and requeues if necessary.
- From each root, follow exact heap edges via the trace map; mark reached young objects and account live bytes / objects / ranges. The mark stops at old objects (reached only through the remembered set).
- A major uses the same trace map without the young gate, rescans all chunk constants, and also seeds remembered mutable edges that cannot always be recovered by rescanning their source object.
- Single-owner ranges (below) mean a `ValueRange`/`AttrRange` needs no mark
  bitmap or separate root. Object scanning defers those owned ranges into
  bounded batches, orders each batch by store / segment / offset, then scans
  the backing values linearly. This extends page-oriented marking across the
  heap's different-sized object, value, and attribute stores rather than
  improving object-header locality while leaving most graph edges random.

## Sweep (reclaim)

- Processing each young object: **marked ⇒ survivor**, promoted in place (`gcSetOld`, id unchanged, ranges stay put); **unmarked ⇒ dead**, its store ranges returned to the free lists in place and its slot id recycled.
- **Worker-local caches with shared overflow** reduce allocation-path
  contention. Sweep returns dead slots and ranges to the allocation worker's
  local cache; unused entries move to shared overflow at the stop-the-world
  boundary. Refill and range allocation use bounded batches, coalescing and
  splitting ranges as needed. Slot ids are LIFO.
- Spilled bytecode/deferred-thunk captures record their value-store range. An unresolved dead thunk returns that range during sweep; a forced thunk returns it immediately after its evaluation frame unwinds and just before publishing its result or sticky error. Transient failures keep the range for retry. Closure frames record and root the heap closure that owns their raw upvalue slice, so a live executing closure keeps its captures while dead closures return their value-store ranges during sweep.
- Non-moving: no compaction pass, so scattered death can leave fragmentation.
- A major sweeps every allocated object slot, tenures survivors, clears the
  remembered set, and rebuilds fragmented free ranges. Major sweep is serial.

## Safepoints

- Collections fire at the `forceThunk` safepoint once allocation volume crosses the pacer's trigger. The coordinating fiber may enter at any native depth because builtin temporaries follow the explicit-root discipline; peer fibers park only at native-depth-zero boundaries before assisting the collection.
- Current-token thunk-memo and attr-cache entries are roots because they can momentarily be the sole reference to a shared value. After collection the **heap token is bumped**, making every old cache slot miss before a recycled ObjectId can be read as the prior value.

## Single-owner range invariant

Every `ValueRange` / `AttrRange` (the backing store for lists and attrsets) has exactly **one owner** object. Therefore **range liveness == owner liveness**: the mark need only trace owners, and the sweep can free a range the moment its owner dies. This invariant is what makes precise marking of the range stores tractable.

## Parallelism

At `--workers=1` a minor is serial on the lone mutator. At `--workers>1` every live worker is parked at a safepoint, so the collector recruits the parked peers:

- **Parallel mark** — atomic seen/scanned/page-state bitmaps plus per-worker
  work-stealing deques for object pages and owned ranges. Each worker
  physically orders a bounded range batch before scanning it. The collector
  seeds roots and the remembered set, then parked peers help drain to global
  termination. `FIX_GC_PAR_CAP` caps participants.
- **Parallel minor sweep** — the per-worker young-object lists form a shared claim loop; each participant promotes marked survivors in place and returns dead slots and ranges to its own free shard.
- **Parallel major mark** — the same parked peers drain a non-young-gated full mark, then remain parked while the collector performs the full sweep serially.
- Evaluation still runs `worker_count`-wide; collection participation is capped. Peers over the cap remain parked.

## Cost and limits

Minor collections mark and sweep young objects; less-frequent major collections
also sweep the old generation. With multiple workers, parked peers help mark
and perform minor sweep, while major sweep remains serial. Force-chain and
temporary-root maintenance must remain complete across the arming boundary.
Non-moving allocation can leave fragmentation, so releasing storage does not
necessarily reduce process memory immediately.

## Correctness tooling

- **UAF detector** (ReleaseSafe): freed slots are *not reused* and every read asserts the alloc bit is set — surfaces dangling ObjectIds at the read, at their source. A companion closure check verifies the minor mark is closed (every young child of a live parent is marked) before the sweep, panicking with the offending parent→child edge so a missed barrier/root is caught at its source.
- **Swept-range poisoning**: freed ranges are overwritten with an invalid thunk so any stale reader trips immediately.
- **`FIX_GC_STEP_MB`**: arm at once and collect every N MB of allocation, ignoring heap shape and `--gc-budget`, to shake out rooting gaps.
- **`FIX_GC_NOREUSE`** (skip free-list reuse; validate the reuse path) and **`FIX_GC_PAR_CAP`** (collection participant cap) are validation/tuning knobs.
- **`--gc-report`** dumps the per-run collection report (pacer configuration and state, total and maximum pauses, promoted/freed, live vs reserved breakdown) to stderr.

Code: `src/runtime/heap/pacer.zig` (when to collect and whether to go major), `src/runtime/gc.zig` (the precise serial/parallel marker and metrics), `src/runtime/heap/collector.zig` (configuration, arming, sweep, and the after-collect hook that feeds the pacer), and `src/expr/eval/gc_controller.zig` (root enumeration, stop-the-world integration, and pacer configuration). The reclaimable-headroom analysis this bounds is in [perf/model](perf/model.md); the measurement flags are in [perf/probes](perf/probes.md).
